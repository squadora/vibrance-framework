# ScrollSpy

This component allows you to check if an element is visible to the user in the page. This is very useful to trigger animations in scroll for example.

## Usage

Add the ```.scrollspy-animation``` class to an element. Then add an animation class (see [Animation component](animation.md));

```html
<div class="scrollspy-animation animation-zoom-in"></div>
```
